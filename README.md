# Friends CRUD Application with Ruby On Rails

Hii there, I just started learning Ruby on Rails and I am really excited about my Journey to the Ruby On Rails(ROR) world.

This is a **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Ruby on Rails. The application allows registered and logged-in users to manage their friends, view their friend list, add new friends, and delete existing friends. Additionally, users can edit their profile information and reset their password if needed.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Ruby (version 3)
- Ruby on Rails (version 7.1)
- PostgreSQL (or any other supported database)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/t-ega/Friends-Application-with-Ruby->
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd friends
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash

7. Start the Rails server:

7. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
